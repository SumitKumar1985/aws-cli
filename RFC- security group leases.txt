This RFC describes a feature request for "security group leases"

On AWS EC2, a security group has ingress and egress rules defined to allow network traffic for specific protocols and ports.
At the moment, these rules do not have any time duration associated with them.

An administrator must necessarily examine all rules in place from time to time to determine which are still valid and needed, or must be removed.

A "security group lease" is one (or more) ingress (or egress) rule(s) that have a time duration assigned when created.

In theory, if security group leases were to be supported as a platform service by AWS, the associated security group rules would be automatically removed at the "expiry of the lease".

At the moment, the CLI can support security group leases on a limited basis.

The CLI would then provide the user some or all of the following facilities:
- Report all of the leases and associated security group rules that are currently in force
- Allow the user to "extend" one or more leases for a further duration of time, or otherwise modify the remaining duration of a lease, including "expiring" the lease
- "Schedule" a lease that is in force only at a pre-defined time, such as 'from the 1st Aug 2014 to 4th Aug 2014' or 'every Wednesday between 10:00 hours to 12:00 hours EST'
- Audit all leases that were in force at any time now or in the past, and so on...

Some common use cases where such leases would help limit access are described below:
- A user in the field needs temporary access, and user traffic originates from a temporary IP address, as is commonly the case when using a mobile device, or ISP access.
If the associated rules are not revoked when the user no longer needs such access, this will present a security hole as such IP address will most likely be re-assigned to another user at random

- Systems (that may belong to independent entities) only exchange network traffic at certain times, and need not be reachable at other times

This topic branch implements security group leases using a data store local to the user's CLI installation. As such, the implementation suffers from the problems inherent to such an approach.
